# REIMS DBF extractor

Python tool for extracting Visual Fox Pro DBF (database files) used inside the REIMS project.

This won't win a clean code achievement and is only a hack to convert the DBF files to an initial mysql dump.


ARCHIVED: This tool has done its part: We successfully converted REIMS1 database to the new REIMS2 project. We no longer use this tool.
